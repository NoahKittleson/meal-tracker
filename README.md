#_README for Meal Tracker_#
###Created by Noah Kittleson###

##**Description**##
This is a webpage that allows the user to track their calories.  Users can edit existing meals that have been entered, add new ones, and sort all meals by calorie count.  Several meal entries are displayed from the get-go for display purposes.

##**Setup**##
This page requires Node.js to manage dependencies, which you can download [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). Once you have downloaded both Node and this project, go to the command line and type:

* `npm install`
* `install bower`

This should install all node dependencies, including those for bower and gulp.  After you have done that, run:

* `gulp build`
* `gulp serve`

and that should open up the webpage for you.
